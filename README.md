jQuery Scroller
===============

jQuery content scroller plugin for overflowing elements. Can scroll in both the vertical and horizontal direction. 
Completely stylable with CSS and very lightweight.

The motivation for making another scroller plugin: the ones I had come across used libraries that were quite large 
and unnecessary. A basic draggable plugin to drag an element within its parenthas been written as well as the scroller. 
Both files minify down to less than 3kB.
