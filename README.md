scroller
========

jQuery content scroller plugin. The motivation for making another scroller plugin: the ones I had come across used 
libraries that were quite large and unnecessary. A basic draggable plugin to drag an element within its parent
has been written as well as the scroller. Both files minify down to less than 3kB.
